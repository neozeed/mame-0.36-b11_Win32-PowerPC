        IE4/5 to use property sheets, the program
        will alert the user if it finds an outdated
        control and tell them where to get it.  If
        they choose to run the program anyway, they
        are restricted by not being able to:

        1) Access the property pages
        2) Can not customize the list view columns.

    Alt-T     toggle tool bar
    Alt-S     toggle status bar
    Alt-D     toggle Folder list
    Alt-R     large screen shot
    Alt-P     Still play current game

    "folder.ico"
    "foldavail.ico"
    "custom.ico"
    "foldmanu.ico"
    "foldunav.ico"
    "foldyear.ico"
    "manufact.ico"
    "working.ico"
    "nonwork.ico"
    "year.ico"
    "neo-geo.ico"

- JPEGs can now be used instead of BMPs as background images
  and as screen shots.
  NOTE: the default image directory is now called .\images.

  You may put *.jpg or *.bmp files in the image directory
  and they will be found by Mame32.  You may zip the images
  into a zipfile inside the image directory and name it 'images.zip'.

  Mame32 will look in the following order to find image files:

  <imagedir>\name.jpg
  <imagedir>\name.bmp
  <imagedir>\images.zip\name.jpg
  <imagedir>\images.zip\name.bmp

  Mame32 will no longer look for bmp.zip in the current
  directory. It must be renamed to 'images.zip' and moved
  to the users images directory. 

  (The images directory is still configurable)

- Added stereo sound support option for the games that use it.

  on Windows NT. The mameopl.sys driver can now be installed and uninstalled by running
  instopl.bat with 'install' or 'remove' as command line parameters.

- Added Dan Miller's Windows Help file.

- Added Robert Schlabbach's Windows NT driver for OPL chip access (ym3812 sound).
  Requires a Sound Blaster compatible sound card. This driver gets loaded
  dynamically for games that use it, so you must run MAME32 with Administrative
  privledges.

- Enabled keyboard LED indicators to emulate the 1 player/2 players start lamps.
  This currently works only in Windows NT.

- Added Audit Tab to Game Property sheet.

- Added Pause/Continue feature to Audit Dialog.

- Added Game Directory under title in Properties popup.

- Widend the audit dialog so that errors don't go over a line.

- Added icons the to game list UI to show ROM availability.
  By putting 4 icons in either the image directory or the current
  working directory users can modify the icons to suit their own tastes:
    noroms.ico  <- ROMS not available
    roms.ico    <- ROMS available
    unknown.ico <- ROM availability unknown
    warning.ico <- game not working (a red X)
  NOTE: These icons cannot be in a zipfile.

- Added support for game specific icons in the game list UI.
  If the game, or the game it's a clone of, has an icon with the same
  name in either icons/*.ico or image directory, and the game is available,
  MAME32 will show the 'custom' icon for that game.

- A tiled background image may be used for the game list UI when viewed as Details.
  To use a background image, create a bmp called "bkground.bmp", and
  place it in the image directory.
  For 256 color display modes, you can also specify a 16 color
  bitmap as "bkgnd16.bmp".

- Addded capability to display screen shots in the UI. The images must
  be in the Windows bmp format, located in the image directory.

  MMX even if the processor supports MMX instructions 

- Added visible area support in fullscreen and DirectDraw windowed mode.
  All display options now support this functionality.

- 16 bit support for the DirectSound option. Fixed samples being cut off.

- Added support for up to four joysticks.

- Updated Wingman Warrior support. The previous version of MAME32 only worked
  with Logitech's oldest 1.0 driver; this new version only works with
  their latest 2.3 driver. To use the Wingman Warrior spinner you need
  their version 2.3 driver, from http://www.logitech.com. And you must select
  the "Use DirectInput for joystick" option.

- Added an audit feature. This checks all your existing ROM sets for missing
  and incorrect ROMs, and for missing samples. From the File menu, choose Audit.

  to be set to 16 bit.

- Added yet another sound option, DirectSound. This uses the DirectX
  DirectSound API. It currently does not support 16 bit samples.

- Option to use a Blit operation for fullscreen mode. This applies to
  the double option with no scanlines. This may or may not result in a
  speed increase. It's actually slower on my machine. YMMV.

- Support for processors with MMX instructions. I (Michael) haven't
  tested this code since I don't have an MMX processor available.

  directories and/or files in this order:
  1) gamename             directory
  2) gamename.zip         zip file
  3) ROMS\gamename        directory
     SAMPLES\gamename     directory

  the MAME code is the creation of the entire MAME team.

- Pause has been changed to no longer waste cpu cycles.

- All of the options are now settable on a per-game basis.  Use 
  View | Default Options to configure your most common options.  For games

  of these options are automatically saved into a file called mame32.cfg.

- The list view of all games can be viewed in detailed mode (like the previous
  version) or in list mode, which just lists the names of the games.  This
  is configured in the View menu.

- You can list either all games that MAME32 supports or just the games that
  have the correct ROM files in place.  This is configured in the View menu.

- Player 1 and Player 2 LEDs are now supported in some games (e.g. Pac Man),
