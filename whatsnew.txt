These drivers have improved GRAPHICS:
-------------------------------------

- Fixed lots of drivers for -depth 16 support. [Zsolt Vasvari]


These drivers have new or improved SOUND:
-----------------------------------------

- Fixed music in cworld2j [CAB]


Other drivers changes:
----------------------

- Fixed Go Go Mr. Yamaguchi [Takahiro Nogi]

- Fixed controls in Ikari III level 2. [Nicola Salmoria]

- Fixed hangs in TNZS. [Quench]


Changes to the main program:
----------------------------

- [DOS] Adjusted the autoframeskip code, to make it increase frameskip a little
  faster, but not as fast as it was before the previous change. Let's see how
  this performs. [Nicola Salmoria]

- Support for gzipped (NOT zipped) cheat files. Uncompressed files still work.
  [Mathis Rosenhauer]


Source:
-------

- Merged the flags and orientation fields of struct GameDriver.

- Removed prom_memory_region from struct GameDriver. The PROM memory region is
  now specified directly in the ROM declaration, with
  ROM_REGIONX( length, REGION_PROMS )
  Similarly, REGION_GFX1..8 are defined for gfx decoding, but drivers have not
  been updated to use them. See drivers/namcos86.c for the only example.

- Removed samplenames from stuct GameDriver. It is now in struct
  SamplesInterface, and some drivers load the samples directly without using
  that structure. Due to this change, -listsamples and -verifysamples, and the
  samples information in -listinfo, are no longer available. Actually, samples
  might not be working at all - I haven't tested them. [Nicola Salmoria]

- Removed base and size from struct MemoryReadAddress, use MemoryWriteAddress
  to store the pointers. Several drivers had the bad habit of using
  MemoryReadAddress to initialize those variables, hopefully I haven't broken
  any while updating them. [Nicola Salmoria]


==========================================================================


0.36 BETA 9.1

The license had to be changed again (VII. Derivative Works).


Other drivers changes:
----------------------

- Fixed a few bugs in the TMS34010 games. [Aaron Giles]

Other drivers changes:
----------------------

- Fixes to Lazer Command and Meadows Lanes. [Malcolm Lear]


Changes to the main program:
----------------------------

- 16 bit support in the tilemap manager, so the Namco System 2 games no longer
  require -depth 8. [Phil Stroffolino]

- [DOS] Changed the -depth option behaviour, now it can be either 8, 16, or
  auto. The default is auto, which uses the color depth appropriate for the
  game. 8 forces use of a 256 colors display (faster but less accurate), 16
  forces use of a 16-bit display (not suggested, doesn't work with all games).
  MAKE SURE TO SET depth = auto IN MAME.CFG, OR YOU'LL USE 16-BIT IN ALL GAMES.

- Fixed a few bugs in the NEC CPU core that caused problems in Hook, Gunforce,
  Lethal Thunder and maybe others. [Bryan McPhail, Nao]

- Several changes and improvements to the TMS34010 emulation and to the
  Williams games using CVSD sound. [Aaron Giles]


Source:
-------

- [DOS] Now compiled with Allegro 3.9.27 WIP.

- Replaced MachineDriver->video_attributes VIDEO_SUPPORTS_16BIT with
  GameDriver->flags GAME_REQUIRES_16BIT.
  Added color_depth to struct RunningMachine and struct GameOptions. OS
  dependant code may set it to force a specific depth.
  Added depth parameter to osd_create_display(). The OS dependant code MUST
  respect it - if it has special requirements, it must set the GameOptions
  flag beforehand.

- Calling palette_recalc() is now *MANDATORY* in all drivers that modify the
  palette. The palette will not be updated otherwise.

- Removed adpcm_sample_list, palette and colortable from struct GameDriver.
  Changed char *color_prom to int prom_memory_region.

- Updated the TMS9900 emulator. [Raphael Nabet]

- Sped up a little the NeoGeo raster effects. Enabled them in Karnov Revenge
  and Galaxy Fight. Fixed the field in ssideki3 etc. [Massimo Morra]

- Fixed sprite Y offset in the Simpsons dreamland level. Apologies for taking
  so long, I couldn't find the time to play it that far and hadn't realized I
  just had to use the attract mode of the Japanese version. [Nicola Salmoria]


These drivers have new or improved SOUND:
-----------------------------------------

- CVSD sound in Mouse Trap. [Dan Boris, Aaron Giles]


Changes to the main program:
----------------------------

- [DOS] Changed the autoframeskip code, making it less anxious to increase
  frameskip as soon as speed drops below 100%. Let's see if this makes things
  better or worse. [Nicola Salmoria]

- [DOS] The mouse buttons are no longer aliases for joystick buttons, they are
  independently recognized. They are still considered "joystick" inputs though,
  so if you want to use them you have to redefine the controls in the Joystick
  menu. This is a minor annoyance that was needed to allow interfacing a Discs
  of Tron controller to the mouse port (spinner + up and down switches) while
  still using joystick buttons 1 and 2 for fire and deflect. [Nicola Salmoria]

- [DOS] Support for ZIPped input files (-playback) and artwork. Well, PNG won't
  compress very well, but I added it anyway ;) [Juergen Buchmueller]


Source:
-------

- Finally fixed the CMPX instruction in the 680x core. On the 6800 it does
  not affect the C flag, on the others (6803, 63701) it does.
  [Tatsuyuki Satoh]

- Fixes to the x86 asm 68k core. [Mike Coates]

- VIDEO_BUFFERS_SPRITERAM. See bionicc, darkseal, lastduel for usage examples.
  [Bryan McPhail]

- Added vh_eof_callback to the MachineDriver structure. See bionicc, cps1,
  lastduel for usage examples. [Nicola Salmoria]

- Cleaned up the 6809 and Konami-2 emulations. [Juergen Buchmueller]

- C140 emulation. [Phil Stroffolino]

  -joy grip or -joy grip4 to enable.


Source:
-------

- [DOS] Now compiled with Allegro 3.9.26 WIP.

- Several improvements to FM sound emulators. This also fixes crashes in some
  Jaleco Mega System 1 games. [Tatsuyuki Satoh]

- Improvements to the other YM2151 emulator too. [Jarek Burczynski]

- VIDEO_UPDATE_BEFORE_VBLANK is now the default. If you want your driver to
  redraw the screen after vblank, use VIDEO_UPDATE_AFTER_VBLANK.

- Rewritten the HC55516 CVSD decoder. This affects Sinistar, Joust 2, Arch
  Rivals, Pigskin, Tri-Sports, Smash TV, Trog, Narc. [Aaron Giles]

- Some improvements to the Z80 emulator. [Juergen Buchmueller]

- Some fixes to HD63701 IRQ handling, and support for ICI (Input Capture
  Interrupt). [Tatsuyuki Satoh]

- Improvements to the 34010 emulation. [Aaron Giles]

- New function findmemorychunk() that lets you look up a chunk of memory and
  get its start/end addresses, and its base. This can be used (carefully!) by
  drivers that wish to access memory directly without going through the
  readmem/writemem accessors (e.g., blitters). [Aaron Giles]

- Replaced cpu_reset() with cpu_set_reset_line().
  cpu_set_reset_line(num,PULSE_LINE) is equivalent to the old cpu_reset().
  ASSERT_LINE resets the cpu and halts it. CLEAR_LINE restarts it.
  This avoids the need to call cpu_halt() in most cases. [Nicola Salmoria]

- Most System 16 games have sound. [Andrew Prime]

- Support for new samples in Q*Bert and Reactor. [Fabrice Frances]

----------------------

- Hacked protection in Wild Western, fixed bonus game, added second button
  to jump onto the train. [Zsolt Vasvari]

- Sea Fighter Poseidon should be working now.

- Various fixes to System 16 games. [Andrew Prime]


Changes to the main program:
----------------------------

- Further improved the YM3812 emulator, especially the rhythm section (check
  Snow Bros!). [Tatsuyuki Satoh]

- [DOS] -noym3812opl is now the default (this won't have effect unless you
  delete mame.cfg). [Nicola Salmoria]

- Fixed a bug in the T-11 emulation which caused APB not to work and the end
  of race results in Super Sprint to contain garbage. [Aaron Giles]


Source:
-------

- Rewritten the OS dependant joystick interface, it's like the keyboard
  interface now. Also a few function renames, and osd_wait_keypress() must
  now return a keycode. [Nicola Salmoria]

- [DOS] The above should remove all limitations on number of axis and buttons,
  so e.g. joypads with multiple sticks should work. Changes to the analog
  devices handling will follow. [Nicola Salmoria]

- Konami 052001/053248 CPU emulation, used by many games. [Ernesto Corvi,
  Manuel Abadia]

- Konami 053260 sound chip emulation. [Ernesto Corvi]

- Sega PCM and RFC68 sound emulators, used by System 16. [Hiromitsu Shioya]

- Moved the profiler into the core. The OS dependant code need only provide a
  osd_cycles() inline function/macro in osinline.h, returning a counter. The
  function must be as low overhead as possible since it is called thousands
  of times per second when the profiler is active. The counter should be as
  precise as possible, to provide accurate measurements; the ideal unit is the
  number of CPU cycles, e.g. as returned by the Pentium instruction RDTSC.
  The profiler display is handled by the core, so the OS code only has to make
  the usual profiler_mark() calls to profile different sections of the code
  (PROFILER_BLIT, PROFILER_SOUND and so on).
  Note: to avoid conflicts, the OS code must do the check for the "show fps"
  key this way, otherwise input will be lost:
	if (!keyboard_pressed(KEYCODE_LSHIFT) && !keyboard_pressed(KEYCODE_RSHIFT)
		&& !keyboard_pressed(KEYCODE_LCONTROL) && !keyboard_pressed(KEYCODE_RCONTROL)
		&& input_ui_pressed(IPT_UI_SHOW_FPS))
  [Nicola Salmoria]

- [DOS] The -profiler switch is no longer needed to enable the profiler, it is
  automatically turned on and off when you hit Shift+F11. [Nicola Salmoria]

Changes to the main program:
----------------------------

- New digital YM3812/YM3526 emulator (in the DOS version, use -noym3812opl to
  enable it). It doesn't support the rhythm section yet, but is overall better
  than the old one. [Tatsuyuki Satoh]

- [DOS] Triple buffer support in tweaked VGA modes. Warning: this is slower
  than standard tweaked modes. [Brian Lewis]

- [DOS] If you are using a HotRod, use the -hotrod switch to adjust the default
  keyboard settings. [Nicola Salmoria]


Source:
-------

- [DOS] Compiled with Allegro WIP 3.9.23. IMPORTANT: there is a bug in
  Allegro's new keyboard hangling, which will prevent numeric pad keys from
  working properly when used together with ctrl and alt. Until it is fixed in
  the main Allegro distribution, you will have to replace the source file
  allegro\src\misc\pckeys.c with the provided one, and recompile Allegro.
  [Nicola Salmoria]

- [DOS] The new Allegro provides support for PSX and N64 pads (info here:
  http://www.debaser.force9.co.uk/ccmame), and for the Wingman Warrior.
  The names for the -joy parameter are
  psxlpt1
  psxlpt2
  psxlpt3
  n64lpt1
  n64lpt2
  n64lpt3
  wingwarrior
  [Nicola Salmoria]

- Rewritten the OS dependant keyboard interface. A rewrite of the koystick
  interface will follow. The OS dependant code now only has to provide four
  functions:
  osd_get_key_list()
  osd_is_key_pressed()
  osd_customize_inputport_defaults() [optional]
  osd_wait_keypress() [optional]
  everything else is handled by the main core.
  [Nicola Salmoria]

- New sprite manager, used in System 16, Ninja Gaiden, Shoot Out, Blood Bros.
  [Phil Stroffolino]

- Took the gfx drawing functions out of common.c into the new dragfx.c.
  In preparation for further changes to the data structures, abstracted the
  low level data copying and used macros to generate 8-bit and 16-bit
  versions. [Nicola Salmoria]
